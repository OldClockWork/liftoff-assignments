# Start Here!
Welcome to Liftoff! We are excited to have you in this course.

You are currently viewing the Liftoff Assignments Repository. This repo contains information about all of the assignments in the course, and will be how you will submit much of your work.

## Repo Explanation
In Liftoff we are focusing on two things: your Personal Project, and Career Readiness skills. Throughout this course you will have assignments related to both of those core areas. Looking through this repo you can see Personal Project assignments, and Career Readiness assignments.

Personal Project Assignments are flagged with P#, and Career Readiness assignments are flagged with C#, both are followed by the name of the assignment.

You will use this repository in tandem with Canvas. All of your grades will be recorded in Canvas, however you will submit your work through this GitHub repository.

We are making you use GitHub for two important reasons:
<ol>
<li>You will get more practice with GitHub</li>
<li>Your assignments are all stored in one place</li>
</ol>

Overview
    A webapp that allows its users to create an account and organize lists of the type of hardware they're looking to
    buy as well as allow them to design their own rig to have the hardware they want in a PC. Once they've
    designed the kind of computer they want then the site will list the total price, processing speed, and the
    amount of storage space of the designed rig. A class system will be added with a admin having the ability to add
    sales to hardware or increase their prices. Users will also be able to list their currently owned computers and be
    able to compare with either the rig their creating or with certain hardware to see what is improved.



Features

	- Rig Builder: Enable users to build their own computer for purchase before listing the total price, memory space,
	and processing speed.

	- Wish List: Users will be able to create a list of both the hardware or the computers they want.

	- Login/Register: Enable Users to create and login to their own account.
